# How to buy Padelcash (PADEL)

Buying Padelcash is easy, but if you have not used crypto wallets or traded digital currencies before we are adding here below some of the different methods of buying Padelcash that might be easier to you.


## STEP 1: Select which Digital crypto wallet you would like to use.

Digital crypto wallets are pretty much like bank accounts but for digital currencies. You can create a wallet, in which you can hold your digital currencies and from there you can receive and send digital currencies to other wallets or pay for services using digital currencies. Think of a wallet pretty much as the same mechanism as a bank account.

Some wallets also allow you to buy digital currencies within the wallet, they do that by connecting with exchanges (i.e. trading platforms under the hood), therefore helping you to avoid the need of creating an account on exchanges and saving you an extra step to buy digital currencies. They might charge an additional 2% or 3% commission fee but this method could be really recommended if you want to save time or avoid having to create accounts on exchanges or are just new into the digital currencies and crypto world.

Padelcash recommends the following wallets. They are some of the most widely used and they also connect with third-party exchanges so that that you can buy digital currencies within the wallet:

<b>Our recommendations are:</b>

•	Metamask (Web Browser Extension and Mobile app wallet)<br/>
•	WalletDirect - Binance Wallet (Web browser extension Wallet)<br/>
•	Trust Wallet (Mobile App Wallet)


The three of them allow you to buy digital currencies within the wallet and the three of them are used daily by tens of millions of users worldwide to transfer, receive, and trade.

### • Add BUSD to your Metamask Wallet

	Metamask Web Browser Extension

1\.	<b>Open your Metamask Web-browser extension and go to your Binance Smart Chain. (You need to add the Binance Smart Chain network since you need to buy BUSD – See here how to add the Binance Smart Chain Network)</b>

	</div>
<br/>

2\.	<b>Once you are on the Binance Smart Chain click on the buy button and select the third-party service to buy BUSD. </b>

Our Preference is MoonPay but both, Transak and Moonpay work equally well.

If it is the first time using Transak or MoonPay you might need to send them proof of ID. It takes 5-10 minutes for them to verify your ID and is a pretty straight forward process.

## STEP 2: Add BinanceUSD (BUSD) balance to your Wallet

Once you’ve selected which Wallet you want to use and have installed the app or downloaded the wallet browser extension you need to buy BUSD, the stablecoin currency used for pair trading with PADEL.

BinanceUSD is a 1:1 USD backed stablecoin (Stable digital currency) approved by the New Yok State Department of Financial services (NYDFS).

1 BUSD is essentially 1 USD.

2\. <b>You will be redirected to MoonPay where you can select how much BUSD you want to buy and in what FIAT currency.</b>

If it is the first time you use MoonPay you might be requested to verify your ID before you can start buying digital currencies with their third-party service. It is a simple process that takes approximately 5 minutes. After submitting your verification documents, it might take around 30 minutes to verify your ID.

## STEP 4: See your Padelcash in your wallet

With the high variety of Digital currencies that exist in circulation, crypto wallets come only by default with the main mainstream currencies installed. You need to tell your wallet that you want to track PADEL so it will be set up on your Wallet and track the amount that you own.

This is how you set up PADEL on your wallet after you’ve purchased.

<b>4.1 Get the Padelcash smart contract address</b>

- Go to the Padelcash token page [https://bscscan.com/token/0xa8c827364a27f2179f055d3c7bd5dfe7a526648f](https://bscscan.com/token/0xa8c827364a27f2179f055d3c7bd5dfe7a526648f) and copy the smart contract address that appears on the top right hand of the Token page.
