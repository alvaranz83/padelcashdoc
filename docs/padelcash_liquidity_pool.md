Buying Padelcash is super easy. We have a PADEL liquidity pool at the decentralised Exchange (DEX) [www.pancakeswap.finance](https://www.pancakeswap.finance) where you can buy Padelcash using BinanceUSD (BUSD)

Padelcash is highly liquid, and you can always sell your PADEL for BUSD and viceversa.

Why we use BUSD as collateral?: BUSD is a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar (USD) issued from Binance. It is approved by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), a regulator known throughout the finance industry for applying exceptionally rigorous standards to the entities and products it oversees. BUSD is always available for purchase and redemption at a rate of 1 BUSD to 1 USD. Therefore by building a liquidity pool PADEL < > BUSD, PADEL holders are not affected by price volatility from its trading pair conserving the value and avoiding impermanent loss.  
BUSD is designed with three key areas in mind: high-quality reserves, audits, and regulation and is 100% backed by cash or cash equivalents, so when you hold PADEL you can rest reassured that you always at any time can exchange it for BUSD.
