# Join the VendorEcosystem & Accept Padelcash as a form of Payment

If you are a Padel club, coach, e-commerce or raquet/clothing brand and want to accept Padelcash as a payment form all you have to do is to email us to [newvendor@padel.cash](mailto:newvendor@padel.cash) and we will take you through the process which is fairly straight forward.
 
Please specify on the email what Padel services do you provide, who is your audience and your location, and we will get back to you within 48 hours with the next steps to set you up a vendor wallet address so that you can start accepting Padelcash as well as and minting new PADEL coins with each sale.
