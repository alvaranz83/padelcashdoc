A1 - With Multiple orders placed simultaniously there might be some price volatility at the time you place yoru transcation. The \u201cminimun received\u201d amount guarantees that in the case of high price movements during your orer you should receive that amount of Padel as aminimun. Otherwise if the amount would be less your order would be reverted and not processed. Q2 - What does \u201cPrice Impact\u201d means on the trading box of PancakeSwap? A2- Price impact is the difference between the current Market price of PADEL and the impact that your trade has on the price. Q3 \u2013 What is the Liquidity Provider Fee? A3 \u2013 Unlike centralised Market Places where there are buyers and Sellers setting up the price of a token or stock, in a decentralised exchange there might not be enough buyers or sellers to \u201cbuy from you\u201d or \u201csell to you\u201d the digital currency that you want to buy, this is where Liquidity providers and AMM (Automated Market Makers) come in. Liquidity providers in essence are external individuals or companies that provide Liquidity for a certain digitall currency or Token. They do by adding in a pool 2 digital currencies so that they can be traded. In the case of PADEL, the Liquidity Pool is contained of PADEL and BUSD so that they can be traded for each other, hence have liquidity. Decentralised exchanges reward Liquidity providers with a small % of each fee for locking their funds to be able to trade digital currencies. In Exchange for providing liquidity for pair trading they are granted a small fee of each transaction. In the case of Padelcash, everytime you buy PADEL a tiny small % goes to the LP provider as a reward. Q4- What Does \u201cDefault Transaction speed (GWEI)\u201d means: A4 - Each transaction on the blockchain needs to be validated by nodes, the gas fee is a small fraction of each transaction that goes as a reward for blokchain validators. Its default rate is about ~0.25% of the amount that you\u2019re trading. If many transactions are being requested to the blockchain at particular times, you might need to pay a higher gas fee for your transaction to go through.

STEP 1: Select which Digital crypto wallet you would like to use. Digital crypto wallets are pretty much like bank accounts but for digital currencies. You can create a wallet, in which you can hold your digital currencies and from there you can receive and send digital currencies to other wallets or pay for services using digital currencies. Think of a wallet pretty much as the same mechanism as a bank account. Some wallets also allow you to buy digital currencies within the wallet, they do that by connecting with exchanges (i.e. trading platforms under the hood), therefore helping you to avoid the need of creating an account on exchanges and saving you an extra step to buy digital currencies. They might charge an additional 2% or 3% commission fee but this method could be really recommended if you want to save time or avoid having to create accounts on exchanges or are just new into the digital currencies and crypto world. Padelcash recommends the following wallets. They are some of the most widely used and they also connect with third-party exchanges so that that you can buy digital currencies within the wallet: Our recommendations are: \u2022 Metamask (Web Browser Extension and Mobile app wallet) \u2022 WalletDirect - Binance Wallet (Web browser extension Wallet) \u2022 Trust Wallet (Mobile App Wallet) The three of them allow you to buy digital currencies within the wallet and the three of them are used daily by tens of millions of users worldwide to transfer, receive, and trade. STEP 2: Add BinanceUSD (BUSD) balance to your Wallet Once you\u2019ve selected which Wallet you want to use and have installed the app or downloaded the wallet browser extension you need to buy BUSD, the stablecoin currency used for pair trading with PADEL. BinanceUSD is a 1:1 USD backed stablecoin (Stable digital currency) approved by the New Yok State Department of Financial services (NYDFS). 1 BUSD is essentially 1 USD. \u2022 Add BUSD to your WalletDirect- Binance Wallet: 1. Open your Wallet Direct \u2013 Binance Wallet browser extension and click the Buy button 2. You will be redirected to MoonPay where you can select how much BUSD you want to buy and in what FIAT currency. If it is the first time you use MoonPay you might be requested to verify your ID before you can start buying digital currencies with their third-party service. It is a simple process that takes approximately 5 minutes. After submitting your verification documents, it might take around 30 minutes to verify your ID. 3. Once your verification is approved you can buy BUSD using Fiat and once your transaction completes you can head back to your Binance Wallet and you will see your BUSD \u2022 Add BUSD to your Trust Wallet 1. Open your TrustWallet Mobile app on IOS or Android and tap the button Buy 2. Select how much Binance Peg-USD you want to buy. Make sure it is the BEP-20 token. You will get different quotes from different providers, select the quote that works best for you or if you already use any of these third-party providers you can use it for convenience. We recommend to use MoonPay to buy directly from the TrustWallet app. 3. Once you confirm your transaction you can go back to your Trust Wallet and you will see you the purchased BUSD \u2022 Add BUSD to your Metamask Wallet Metamask Web Browser Extension 1. Open your Metamask Web-browser extension and go to your Binance Smart Chain. (You need to add the Binance Smart Chain network since you need to buy BUSD \u2013 See here how to add the Binance Smart Chain Network) 2. Once you are on the Binance Smart Chain click on the buy button and select the third-party service to buy BUSD. Our Preference is MoonPay but both, Transak and Moonpay work equally well. 3. Select the amount of BUSD that you want to buy. Metamask Mobile App 1. Open your Metamask Mobile app and go to your Binance Smart Chain Network. (If you have not added your Binance Smart Chain Network on Metamask, here is how you can do it. See here how to add the Binance Smart Chain Network) 2. Tap on the \u201cBuy\u201d button and you will be redirected to buy BUSD using MoonPay or Transak directly from the Metamask mobile app. Select how much BUSD you want to buy. If it is the first time using Transak or MoonPay you might need to send them proof of ID. It takes 5-10 minutes for them to verify your ID and is a pretty straight forward process. 3. Select how much you want to buy, the payment method and confirm transaction. STEP 3: Buy PADEL in PancakeSwap using BUSD 1. Go to www.pancakesawp.finance and login using your wallet provider. Make sure you are connected to the BNB Smart Chain Network both in PancakeSwap and in your wallet. 2. Go to the Trade option on the top left hand side menu, click swap and select the trading pairs BUSD and PADEL. You can specific how much PADEL you want to buy or how much BUSD you want to spend in PADEL. STEP 4: See your Padelcash in your wallet With the high variety of Digital currencies that exist in circulation, crypto wallets come only by default with the main mainstream currencies installed. You need to tell your wallet that you want to track PADEL so it will be set up on your Wallet and track the amount that you own. This is how you set up PADEL on your wallet after you\u2019ve purchased. 4.1 Get the Padelcash smart contract address Go to the Padelcash token page https://bscscan.com/token/0xa8c827364a27f2179f055d3c7bd5dfe7a526648f and copy the smart contract address that appears on the top right hand of the Token page. Here is the address, you can simply copy the following address which is the same that appears in the token web page 0xa8C827364A27F2179F055D3C7Bd5dfe7A526648f 4.2 Add the smart contract address into your Wallet so that it can start tracking the PADEL digital currency. Go to your Metamask Browser app or Mobile app and make sure you are on the BNB Smart Chain Network. On the Web browser extension go to your assets TAB and click in the link \u201cImport Tokens\u201d at the bottom of the page.
